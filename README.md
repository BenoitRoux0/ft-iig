# Infinite Improbability Generator

I'm sharing with you a testing tool that I developed to help me in my studies at 42 Lyon.

**DISCLAIMER** : It is a tool, so automatic tests are not enough to validate a correction, remember to check everything yourself.

If you find a problem, don't hesitate to open an issue and if you want to participate you can open a pull request.

## Get started (just run)

Run `launcher.py` for auto-update else run `main.py`.
```
git clone https://github.com/tdameros/ft-iig
cd ft-iig
python3 launcher.py
```
